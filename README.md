# CPSC 44000: Portfolio

## Author
Jefferson Cherrington **(@jacnok)**

## Origin
This repository is based off a simple Azure hosted static website template, originally created by Prof. Eric Pogue **(@EricJPogue)**.

## Purpose
This portfolio is intended to be a work-in-progress project that will be continuously updated _(with new links to other projects)_ throughout the fall semester of 2023.

In theory, it should act as a one-stop-shop for every project I create in CPSC 44000 and similar classes, while at Lewis University.
